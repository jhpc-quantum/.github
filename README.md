The JHPC-quantum project is aiming to develop system software to integrate quantum computers and supercomputers (HPC), targeting a cutting-edge quantum computer, which is expected to make significant progress toward practical use in the next few years, and to build a HPC-supercomputer hybrid computing platform that will enable computation in areas of uncharted computational capability. Our platform will be operated and served to perform computation in areas that have been difficult to achieve with conventional computers. Our goal is to operate the platform, and develop applications using both quantum computers and HPCs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the platform. Furthermore, we will develop technologies to deploy the quantum/HPC hybrid application software executed on this platform as a service provided by networks in the post-5G era.
